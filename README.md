[“In C”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C) is a musical piece intended to be played by a variable amount of performers. The piece is divided into 53 segments that are to be played, “consecutively with each performer having the freedom to  determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next.” 

Performers are expected to stay within two or three patterns of each other. Once each performer is on the last segment, each performer repeats the last pattern until everyone arrives there, and then they each drop out one by one. This performance is truncated from the preferred 45-90 seconds per segment to 7.5-15 seconds per segment if played at 120 bpm.

On the right, you will see each performer and their current segment as well as a tempo control. In the visualization, each color corresponds to the note being played with red being “C”. The x axis and width of the note are relative to the pitch. When a line appears brighter, it is because performers are overlapping the same pitch.

This pen was inspired by a CodePen-powered performance of “In C” by [Bryant Smith](http://codepen.io/barefootfunk) at a recent CodePen Chicago meetup, which you can read more about and view a video of [here](http://codepen.io/poopsplat/post/codepen-chicago-june-2016).
