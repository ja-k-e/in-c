    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C">“In C”</a> is a musical piece intended to be played by a variable amount of performers.
    The piece is divided into 53 segments that are to be played, “consecutively with each performer having the freedom to
    determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next.” 
    This performance is truncated from the preferred 45-90 seconds per segment to 7.5-15 seconds per segment if played at 120 bpm.
